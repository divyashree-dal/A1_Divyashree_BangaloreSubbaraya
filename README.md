## Note

* I have created Lo-Fidelity prototypes for the entire feature. Due to time constraints, I have developed a semi-functional prototype for one of the tasks i.e. user registration.


## Front-end Framework used

* I have used Material UI as part of my front end development.

  Justification: 
		 * Material UI is an open-source, user-friendly React front-end framework [5].
		 * Material UI provides extensive documentation that makes it simple to traverse the framework. 
		 * Material UI is a flexible 12-grid system that enables developers to design responsive websites [5]. 
		 * Material UI allows us to reuse code while also customizing it to meet our design needs while providing a high-quality digital experience. 
		 * Material UI offers diverse, vibrant design options that entice people to check them out and include them in their development.
		 * Material UI is a trendy framework utilized by numerous firms such as JP Morgan, Walmart, Spotify, and many more, paving the door for fantastic job prospects [1].


## Colour theme

* I have used brown as my colour background theme since brown indicates hunger like emotion.  


## Sources Used

I have referred the following:

* The main documentations of React and material-ui mainly for detailed syntaxes of different tags like typography, paper, text-fields, forms, checkbox, snake bar, card area, Input Adornment, MuiPhoneNumber, MuiAlert. Moreover, I have also used the material icons for all text fields that are part of the user registration [1].

* Usage of material-ui framework with React [2].  

* The image for the card area on the user registration page [3]. 

* I have taken my source code that I had written as part of tutorial 3 activity as reference for the A1 individual submission [4].
