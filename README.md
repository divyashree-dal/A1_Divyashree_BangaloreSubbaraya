## Note

I have created Lo-Fidelity prototypes for the entire feature. Due to time constraints, I have developed a semi-functional prototype for one of the tasks i.e. user registration.


## Sources Used

I have referred the following:

* The main documentations of React and material-ui mainly for detailed syntaxes of different tags like typography, paper, text-fields, forms, checkbox, snake bar, card area, Input Adornment, MuiPhoneNumber, MuiAlert. Moreover, I have also used the material icons for all text fields that are part of the user registration [1].

* Usage of material-ui framework with React [2].  

* The image for the card area on the user registration page [3].
